% >> Abstract
% Abstract processing:
% 1. **DO NOT use \include or \input** to include the abstract: our abstract extractor will not search through other files than this one.
% 2. **DO NOT use %**                  to comment out sections of the abstract: the extractor will still grab those lines (and they won't be comments any longer!).
% 3. For PASs: **DO NOT use tex macros**         in the abstract: CDS MathJax processor used on the abstract doesn't understand them _and_ will only look within $$. The abstracts for papers are hand formatted so macros are okay.
\abstract{
   We present a search for long-lived particles (LLPs) produced in gluon fusion Higgs production mode (ggH), using a novel strategy of Regions of Interest (ROIs). Regions of Interest are collections of pair-wise track vertices fitted by the vertex fitter in CMSSW.
   The analysis focuses LLPs with lifetimes that result in decays in the tracker region, with concentration on the ggH production mode for the highest Higgs cross-section.
   Variables of the constructed ROIs become inputs for our Deep Neural Network (DNN) Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as a main distriminator between the signal and the background. 
   We focus on the Standard Model (SM) $\tau$ lepton final state. This final state is particulary interesting, given $\tau$ lepton final state exclusion limits are frequently omitted in precedent analyses, due to $\tau$ leptons' non trivial reconstruction mechanisms.
  No excess of events over the standard model expectation is observed.
  The results are interpreted in the context of exotic Higgs decays to a pair of long-lived scalars ($S$).
  We set limits on the branching ratio of the Higgs to LLPs, \textbf{B}(H$\rightarrow SS$)
  , as a function of the proper lifetime. 
 % The expected limits
 % constrain the \textbf{B}(H$\rightarrow SS$) to be below $\sim$4-5~\% ($\sim$15\%) for masses
 % of 40-55~\GeV (15~\GeV) and proper lifetimes of 10-100~\mm (10-50~\mm).

% >> PDF Metadata
% Do not comment out the following hypersetup lines (metadata). They will disappear in NODRAFT mode and are needed by CDS.
% Also: make sure that the values of the metadata items are sensible and are in plain text:
% (1) no TeX! -- for \sqrt{s} use sqrt(s) -- this will show with extra quote marks in the draft version but is okay).
% (2) no %.
% (3) No curly braces {}.
