About systematic Uncertainty

%Table 6 contains a summary of the systematic uncertainties which affect the outcome of
%the analysis. All uncertainties are applied on a per bin basis in the distribution of Ndis
%jet. The
%largest of these uncertainties comes from the statistical uncertainty on the MC transfer factor
%in the 2 or more tagged jets bin. This uncertainty is due to the statistics limitations of MC for
%the 2 or more tagged jets bin and is capped to be at most 90%. The signal and background
%yields are affected by the uncertainty on the collected luminosity during the 2016 - 2018
%data taking period, which was found to be 1.8% [4, 5, 6]. The lepton uncertainties affect the
%efficiency in reconstructing the Z, overall these uncertainties are small ( 1 -2%). The lepton
%energy scale uncertainties are derived from the study of leptonic decays of the Z boson as
%described in [34] and correspond to a 1-2% effect to be applied to both the signal and
%background. The uncertainty due to the lepton ID and isolation scale factors and associated
%uncertainties are derived through a dedicated tag and probe analysis where the Z mass is
%fitted from the dilepton final states in the  process, first described in [2];
%the resulting effect is a  1-2% effect that is applied to the signal. The same tag and probe
%method is used to derive the dilepton trigger scale factors and uncertainties. The uncertainty
%due to the dilepton trigger account for a 1% effect on both the signal and background. The
%jet energy scale affects the jet pT distribution and ultimately the value of the cut used on the
%minimum jet pT used by the analysis. The effect of the jet energy scale uncertainty on the
%analysis is derived by shifting the jet pT distribution up and down according to the size of
%the uncertainty on the jet energy scale factor and measuring the largest deviation seen in the
%corresponding MC transfer factor, this accounts for a  2-8% effect and is applied to both
%signal and background. The final larger systematic effects come from the MC mismodeling
%(discussed in 4.2.4) on the displaced jet tagging variables and the measured effect due to the
%background estimation global fit method. As was done for the uncertainty due to the jet
%energy scale, the uncertainty due to the MC mismodeling is similarly derived by measuring
%the largest deviation in the MC transfer factor for a particular region and is applied to both
%the signal and background. The uncertainty due to the background estimation method is
%discussed in 5.2 and accounts for an additional 15% effect to be applied to the background.
%The control region (statistical) uncertainty in the signal region is derived by extrapolating
%the yield in the signal region with the assistance of the transfer factors and propagating the
%uncertainty from the control region to the signal region, this is determined to be 0.15%.
%The signal monte carlo statistical uncertainty is 1   10% in the signal region.
