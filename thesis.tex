\begin{acknowledgments}
First, I thank my supervisor Ted Kolberg for instructing me through the CMS experiment. Thanks to him, I have a more thorough understanding of collaboration as a physicist and a member
of society. 
It was an honor to be a member of your group. 
I am grateful for Dr. Adam’s kind welcome to the FSU
CMS community as the head of the FSU-CMS group. Before entering FSU-CMS, I was worried and
suspicious of my capability to work with such talented physics students in the department. 
Thanks to his generous welcome, I could immerse myself in FSU-CMS community and develop strong personal relationships with colleagues in FSU-CMS group. Dr. Yohay
was quitessential for my better understanding of the reconstruction algorithms of tau leptons, which
are infamously difficult and complicated in high energy physics. Dr. Askew’s incisive questions
helped me not to panic in public speeches. I am grateful for Dr. Prosper’s QCD research, diversifying our EXO-dominated FSUCMS community. I still remember my Lepto-quark pre-exercises
and feel thankful for it.

I can not ignore our great theoretical high energy physics community as well. Dr. Tobioka’s
connection to superlative high energy theorists made our fifth floor community so rich. I was lucky
to be able to join seminars of world-class theorists thanks to his connection to those people. I want
to thank Dr. Reina for giving such great lectures on the most complicated subject of physics
study.

I want to express my gratitude to Dr. Hoeflich for his nuclear-Astrophysics class. I sincerely
enjoyed the class, which were outside of the high energy physics. I also want to thank Dr. Liz
Hammock, for introducing me to her neuroscience project on the early developmental stage of primates.
It is great to become an FSU graduate student when you can get introduced to those superb
research on a flight back home just because you are a Nole.

I want to express my appreciation to Andrew Evan Hart for implementing the ROI concept
in CMSSW codes. We will communicate more in the future. I also need to thank Karla Pena
for her continuous communication with the B-parking community, which was critical for my research’s
development. Pedro Vieira de Castro Ferreira da Silva is undoubtedly the kindest person in CMS
collaboration. I was sincerely happy and felt worthy of working for and along with him for the
HGCAL simulation work. Too bad I got to know him only in the middle of 2021, but too lucky that I
got to know him before my departure.

This journey would have been a lot less memorable if I were not with all of my FSU colleagues.
Caleb Benetti, thank you for being my true American friend. 
I hope we keep that friendship after this journey. 
Thank you Karem Esther Penalo Castillo. I believe we were quite a pair. 
I want to congratulate Ryan Kim for his excellent work in FSU-CMS. 
I also want to express my admiration for all of my FSU-CMS colleagues: Mutia, Nick, Ali, Bobby, Rafey, Purbita, Pampa,
Mac, and Redwan. 
You people are truly talented and inspirational. 
I want to thank my 2016 colleagues as well: Bal, Angelica, Yuting, Jing, Lawrence, Jason. 
No doubt, 2016 was the year. 
Last, I want to thank Dr. Daniel Diaz, my 2016 friend and FSU-CMS EXO collaborator.
It was an honor to be a friend of yours and to have worked with you.

Last but not least, thank you, mom, dad, and my sister.

%%% You may also create a list of abbreviations if it may be of use to

%%% might do this:

%\renewcommand*{\listabbrevname}{Index of Scary Movies}

\begin{abstract}
We present a search for long-lived particles (LLPs) produced in gluon fusion Higgs production mode (ggH), using a novel strategy of Regions of Interest (ROIs). Regions of Interest are collections of pair-wise track vertices fitted by the vertex fitter in CMSSW.
   The analysis focuses on LLPs with lifetimes of mm-m ranges, and result in decay of collections of pair-wise track vertices.
   Variables of the constructed ROIs become inputs for our Deep Neural Network (DNN) Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, as the main discriminator between the signal and the background.
	We look for LLPs that decay into two tau leptons. 
	This final state is particularly interesting, given tau lepton final state exclusion limits are mostly omitted in preceding analyses, due to the difficulty of reconstructing tau leptons.
  To trigger on this final state, we exploit the B-parking trigger.
 The B-parking trigger is a novel High-Level Trigger path in CMS detector, targetting soft displaced muons.
 The trigger was installed in 2018, totaling an integrated Luminosity value of $\Lumi_{int}$ = 44fb$^{-1}$.
  No excess of events over the standard model expectation is observed.
  The results are interpreted in the context of exotic Higgs decays to a pair of long-lived scalars ($S$).
	We set limits on the branching ratio of the Higgs to LLPs, \textbf{B}(\PH$\to SS \to \tau^{+}\tau^{-}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$)
  , as a function of the proper lifetime.
  The analysis has the strongest discriminant power for the LLP's c$\uptau$ from 1\mm to 10\mm for 7 and 15\GeV, and from 10\mm to 100\mm for 40 and 55\GeV.
	The analysis' exclusion limit on the branching ratio for $\tau$ lepton final state (\textbf{B}(H$\rightarrow SS \rightarrow \tau^{+}\tau^{-}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$)) is one of the most stringent results from the LHC detectors.
 We place limits on the Higgs branching ratio to this final state down to 9\% at 10\mm for 7\GeV, 5\% at 10\mm for 15\GeV, 5\% at 100\mm for 40\GeV, and 18\% at 100\mm for 55\GeV.

%%% The abstract is the last element of the so-called "front matter"
%%% of the document.  We now move on to the "main matter" --- the
%%% chapter material (and optional appendices).  By calling the
%%% \mainmatter macro, we reset page numbering to arabic numerals
%%% beginning with '1'.

%%% I have chosen to create one new LaTeX file for each chapter of my
%%% document.  This decision is arbitrary.  I may break the document
%%% into as many or as few pieces as I like.  I may name the chapter
%%% and appendix files anything I like (though I might have some
%%% trouble if I use spaces or odd characters in my file names).  The
%%% only requirement is that the file name ends with the extension
%%% '.tex'.  For the \input lines below, I can leave out the '.tex'
%%% extension.  If instead I prefer to create one long file containing
%%% my entire thesis, I may just continue on here by starting with the
%%% first \chapter command of my document.  (In this case, I would not
%%% need the following '\input' commands at all.)  I have chosen to
%%% name my chapter files by the concepts they contain.

%%% Having finished the main text of my document, I will move on to
%%% the appendices (or my one appendix, in this case).  An appendix
%%% will look exactly like a chapter, even including a \chapter macro
%%% call.  By first calling the \appendix macro, I will cause all
%%% subsequent chapter headings to be labeled "Appendix" and to be
%%% enumerated by letters rather than numbers.  I.e., the first
%%% appendix will be titled 'Appendix A', then 'Appendix B', and so
%%% on.  This also adds a heading entry to the Table of Contents
%%% labeled 'Appendix'.  If you have more than one appendix, you may
%%% want to change the ToC heading to read 'Appendices'.  If you need
%%% to do this, you may reset the value of '\appendixtocname' before
%%% the call to the \appendix macro:

%\renewcommand*{\appendixtocname}{Appendices} % For more than one appendix
\appendix
\input appendix


\renewcommand*{\bibname}{References}

%%% The skeleton document in the thesis-template folder gives an
%%% example of the "simple" 'references' environment.  In that
%%% document, you must format all of your own references and manage
%%% your own citation styling.  In contrast, this document assumes
%%% that I will be using BibLaTeX to format my references.  I'll be
%%% using the default plain format style, and the bibliographic data
%%% are kept in the file 'myrefs.bib'. This is specified in the
%%% document preamble above.

%%% If using biblatex/biber, then this is the command required
%%% to render the bibliography/references section correctly.

\printbibliography

%%% If you're using the older BibTeX system, then selecting the
%%% styling and the bibliography invocation are a little different.

%%% Plain LaTeX with BibTeX provides just a few citation and
%%% bibliography styles.  Many more styles are available using
%%% 'natbib', 'apacite', or other packages. A quick web search with
%%% 'bibtex' and your own discipline as keywords may help you locate
%%% both references and the appropriate style files for you to
%%% download. If you '\usepackage{natbib}' or '\usepackage{apacite}'
%%% at the top of this file, then you should uncomment the appropriate
%%% alternative style for the package you've chosen. Uncomment only
%%% one of these:

%\bibliographystyle{ieeetr}    % This is the default LaTeX/BibTeX style
%\bibliographystyle{plainnat} % If using 'natbib', use this line instead
%\bibliographystyle{apacite}  % If using 'apacite', use this line instead

%%% For BibTeX, the following line actually generates the bibliography
%%% using the data supplied in 'myrefs.bib', the citations in my
%%% document, and the style I've selected above.
